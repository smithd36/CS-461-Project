The intended purpose is to implement a program that serves as a shell interface program that performs rudimentary shell actions. The program should accept user commands and then execute each command in a seperate process. To do that, your implementation must utilize the UNIX fork(), exec(), wait(), dip2() and pipe() systems and suppoty input and output redirection and pipes as a form of Inter Process Communication between a pair of commands.
